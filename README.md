# IOS-Capstone-Final
I had a lot of fun making my IOS Capstone planning App called In the KNOW.  As a busy Mom of 4 adorable children, PTA President Extraordinaire, 
Soccer Coach, Youth Volunteer and basically professional Chauffer, I decided I needed to create an app to help me get organized and simplify my life.

In the KNOW app is an interactive planning app that users Core data as its primary source for saving data on a userâ€™s phone.  It consists of two 
data model types of Groups and inside the model Groups Activities.  It allows a user to create a group and then inside the group create activities 
that include space for the activity name, date, time, location and details.  It features regular and unwinding segues and utilizes 5 storyboard screens.
